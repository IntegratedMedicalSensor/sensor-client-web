				answer: "Eight years ago, our founders got the opportunity to work on amazing technologies at worldâ€™s leading research institute (California Institute of Technology). Inspired by an inspiration to improve the lives of family and friends, our founders decided to develop a glucose sensing solution that will make it possible for everyone to manage their chronic condition regardless of their income, age and geographical location. After our founders graduated, they continued to pursue their dreams and formed the company to make this technology a product that can transform lives of people living with diabetes."

We have also won some awards and provided some consulting to get funds without any strings attached so we can focus on our vision."
